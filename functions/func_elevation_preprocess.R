# Description:    this program models the distributed mass balance of a glacier at daily          #
#                 resolution, optimizing model parameters towards the best fit with point         #
#                 mass balance measurements.                                                      #
#                 This file contains the preprocessing of the elevation model to make it          #
#                 suitable for the avalanche redistribution model.                                #
#                 Specifically, there should not be any sinks when considering connectivity       #
#                 with the 4 closest neighbors (rook's case), and there should be no adjacent     #
#                 cells with the same elevation.                                                  #

  # So we find those 4-sinks with focal(), by checking who is lowest in the 4-neighborhood,
  # and we remove those sinks by raising them to the mean of the 4-neighbors.
  # This might stop drainage of some other cell, so we repeat topmodel::sinkfill(),
  # and we iterate until there are no sinks of any kind left.
