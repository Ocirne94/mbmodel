# Description:    this program models the distributed mass balance of a glacier at daily          #
#                 resolution, optimizing model parameters towards the best fit with point         #
#                 mass balance measurements.                                                      #
#                 This file contains the routine to compute the start date for the stakes which   #
#                 were marked as "unknown" (NA), whose start is assigned to the date of the       #
#                 modeled mass balance minimum.                                                   #
