# Description:    this program models the distributed mass balance of a glacier at daily          #
#                 resolution, optimizing model parameters towards the best fit with point         #
#                 mass balance measurements.                                                      #
#                 This file contains the routine to determine the modeling periods, both for      #
#                 the winter period and the annual model.                                         #

# ANNUAL modeling period starts at the beginning of the observation
# period with the earliest start (i.e. the annual stake which was surveyed first
# on the previous year), but no later than Oct 1 (to include the whole hydrological year),
# and no later than the date of fixed mass balance evaluation, set by the user.
# Annual modeling period ends at the end of the observation period with the latest end
# (i.e. the annual stake which was surveyed last on the current year), but no earlier than Sep 30 (hydro year),
# and no earlier than the date of fixed mass balance evaluation, set by the user.
# WINTER modeling period starts at the beginning of the observation period with the earliest start
# (among the winter ones) and ends at the end of the period with the latest end (among the winter ones).
# It is extended to include te dates of fixed mass balance evaluation set by the user.

  # "end of previous ablation season" i.e. mass balance minimum.
  # NOTE: we don't change the modeling period to include stakes
  # which start at NA. So if the mass balance minimum happens
  # before Sep 30 of the previous year and there isn't a measurement
  # before that date, the starting date of those stakes will be
  # set at Sep 30.
  # In the future we may support having a custom starting date.
