# Description:    this program models the distributed mass balance of a glacier at daily          #
#                 resolution, optimizing model parameters towards the best fit with point         #
#                 mass balance measurements.                                                      #
#                 This file contains the routine to correct the map of annual mass balance        #
#                 based on user-defined elevation bands.                                          #
#                 We do this for the mass balance modeled over the measurement period.            #
#                 This will be inaccurate if there are very different dates of stake              #
#                 measurements (e.g. stakes measured in two different campaigns of a same         #
#                 summer), because the correction disregards the time periods corresponding to    #
#                 the given bias.                                                                 #
