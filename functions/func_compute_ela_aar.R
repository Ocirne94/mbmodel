# Description:    this program models the distributed mass balance of a glacier at daily          #
#                 resolution, optimizing model parameters towards the best fit with point         #
#                 mass balance measurements.                                                      #
#                 This file contains the routine to compute the equilibrium line altitude and     #
#                 the accumulation-area ratio (ELA and AAR) after modeling one year.              #

# The equilibrium line altitude is computed by classifying
# the glacier grid into elevation bands (with user-defined
# vertical extent) and then taking the band whose mean mass
# balance over the corrected measured period is closest to 0.
# NOTE: these bands (typically 10 vertical meters wide)
# are NOT the same as for the correction of modeled mass
# balance in elevation bands (glacier-dependent bands),
# and NOT the same as for the plot of modeled mass balance
# vs elevation bands (typically 40 vertical meters wide).
