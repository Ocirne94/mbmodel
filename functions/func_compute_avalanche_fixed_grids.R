# Description:    this program models the distributed mass balance of a glacier at daily          #
#                 resolution, optimizing model parameters towards the best fit with point         #
#                 mass balance measurements.                                                      #
#                 This file contains the one-time computation of derived grids from the DHMs, to  #
#                 be used by the avalanche module.                                                #
