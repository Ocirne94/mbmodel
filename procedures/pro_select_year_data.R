# Description:    this program models the distributed mass balance of a glacier at daily          #
#                 resolution, optimizing model parameters towards the best fit with point         #
#                 mass balance measurements.                                                      #
#                 This file contains the code to select the grids and mass balance measurements   #
#                 of the current year.                                                            #

# We could be using different ids for DEM and DHM (since DEM = DHM + outline, it depends
# on the available outlines); and also w.r.t. surface type because the
# elevation grids can also be interpolated annually (unlike surface type).
# So we have different _id variables.
# The fixed avalanche grids use the same indices as the DHM ones.
