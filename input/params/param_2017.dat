* Input parameters for mass balance model
*
* Accumulation
1200     : [%] cprec, precipitation correction - START VALUE, WILL BE OPTIMIZED (if winter data available)
15       : [% / 100m], precgrad, precipitation gradient
0.2     : [-] sumprecfact, factor for reducing precipitation correction during summer
0       : 1: evaluate snow distribution based on winter measurements, 0: do NOT evaluate snowdist based of this year's data
none    : alternative year for snow distribution (must be preprocessed)
*
* Melt:
-0.65    : [deg C / 100m], tempgrad, air temperature gradient
1.0     : [mm w.e. C-1 d-1], mf, melt factor
1.0     : [10^-3 mm w.e. C-1 h-1 (W m-2)-1], rice, radiation factor ice
0.65    : [10^-3 mm w.e. C-1 h-1 (W m-2)-1], rsnow, radiation factor snow
*
* Finalization
3450,3600,3700,3800     : [m a.s.l.] corrbands, bands among which final mass balance is corrected to agree with in situ measurements
